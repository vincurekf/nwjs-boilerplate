Nwjs Boilerplate to let you start faster.

## Wut?
So what is this? Burgundy is upgraded nwjs-boilerplate with:
- window state (last position & size) save/load function
- tray icon preset
- minimize to tray
packed to one function called ```viewbox```.

And:
- frameless window
- top titlebar with minimize and close buttons

For quick start with styling there is Skeleton framework and Ionic icons.

Use this as you wish, I just maintaining it as I_m learning with NWJS framework for later usage and hopefuly I'll update it with new findings.
